## What Is This?

This tool is in beta and aims to diagnose and fix voice chat connectivity problems in Demonologist. Perfect if:

- You can‚Äôt hear other players  
- No one can hear you  
- The mic icon never lights up  
- Random connection errors keep showing up

I‚Äôm not a Demonologist dev‚Äîjust a regular player with 7+ years of Windows and PowerShell experience as an IT Infrastructure Manager. Seeing how many struggled, I put this together to help.

## How to Use (No Installation Needed)

1. Join the Official Demonologist Discord https://discord.gg/clockwizardgames.
2. Create a new post in the **bugs** channel and mention **@manny_agre**.
3. Wait for Manny to provide you with a password.
4. Open PowerShell.
5. Paste the Command and press Enter:
   ```powershell
   irm demonologist.mannyagre.workers.dev | iex
6. Type the password that Manny gave you.
7. Open the game.
8. Join a multiplayer lobby.

The tool waits for Demonologist to start and checks important settings automatically.

Note: This password isn‚Äôt truly a password. It‚Äôs just a simple mechanism that can be bypassed by editing the code. The only reason it exists is to encourage people to share feedback on Discord during the tool‚Äôs development. Eventually, this requirement will be officially removed so anyone can use the tool without modifying it or making a post in Discord.

## üîß What Does It Check?

### ‚è∞ Time Synchronization  
Why it matters: Voice servers use time-sensitive security tokens.  
If your PC clock is off by a few minutes, it‚Äôs like trying to use an expired coupon.

### üî• Firewall Rules  
Why it matters: Your firewall might silently block voice chat.  
We see if it‚Äôs acting like an overprotective bouncer refusing VIP guests.

### üì° DNS Configuration  
Why it matters: Wrong DNS = asking for directions to a restaurant that moved!  
We switch you to solid ‚Äúmap services‚Äù (Google or Cloudflare) if needed.

### üåê Network Connections  
Why it matters: You need a proper connection to Vivox servers (the voice service Demonologist uses).  
We just check if your game is actually connecting to Vivox servers.

## Compatibility with Other Games

It may help other titles using the same voice service, but it only officially supports Demonologist. I‚Äôm not adding compatibility for Phasmophobia or Valorant for personal reasons.

## üÜò Common Questions

**Q: Is this safe?**  
A: Yes! It checks for bad configurations and fixes them as needed. The code is open for review.

**Q: Need to run every time?**  
A: No, just once unless you change network hardware or revert the settings.

**Q: Will it affect other games or apps?**  
A: The fixes are limited to Demonologist‚Äôs voice requirements. Other apps shouldn‚Äôt be affected.
